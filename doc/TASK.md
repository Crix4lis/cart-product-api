# TASK DESCRIPTION
Create a simple application allowing adding products to the cart. The application should
consist of two HTTP APIs (in a RESTful manner if possible)

## GUIDELINES
 - there is no need for frontend UI (unless you really want to show your frontend skills
as well ;)), just expose every action through REST APIs.
 - Code should be PHP-based
 - Tests are very welcome
 - Impress us, you can over-engineer it - we want to see your programming skills.
